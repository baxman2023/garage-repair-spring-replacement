Additionally, if your garage door has multiple springs, replacing all of them at once may result in a higher total cost compared to only replacing one or two.<br /> <br /> Furthermore, any additional repairs needed for your garage door can also impact (impact!) the average cost of spring replacement. If there are issues with other components such as cables or rollers that need repair or replacement, this will add to the total expense.
